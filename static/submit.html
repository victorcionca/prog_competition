        <h2>Current best score: {{ .Score }}</h2><br>
        <h2>Submit and test solution</h2><br>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="one-half column">
        Before submitting make sure that your solution runs correctly.<br>
        The solution is run in a sandbox that blocks a set of functions such as 
        attempting to access the filesystem. If you are using such functions an
        error will be returned at runtime.
        <br>
        Your solution will be evaluated by running it with the first 1000 seeds (0-999),
        excluding the list of seeds that results in no path between start and end.
        <br>
        Failures to reach the target are scored at 999 for the respective seed.
        <br>
        If in a run the solution stalls for more than 5 seconds it will be stopped,
        and the score will be the one reached at that point.
