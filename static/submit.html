        <h2>Current best score: {{ .Score }}</h2><br>
        <h2>Submit and test solution</h2><br>
        Before submitting make sure that your solution runs correctly.<br>
        Your solution will be evaluated by running it 5 times with different random
        seeds.<br>
        In each run the difficulty (probability of new asteroids) increases by 5
        with every 10,000 steps.<br>
        If in a run the solution stalls for more than 5 seconds it will be stopped,
        and the score will be the one reached at that point.
